POJOs and Java Beans are usually information holders.\n- **Service Provider**: Responsible for handling requests and performing specific services. It usually implements a specific interface with a small number of methods. Concrete strategies are service providers.\n- **Structurer**: Responsible for managing relationships and constraints among related things. It is usually a collection or mapping of some sort.\n- **Controller**: Responsible for making decisions, directing the work of others, and handling important events. It directs the flow of the application or business process.\n- **Coordinator**: Responsible for managing the actions of a group of workers and facilitating communication and work of other objects. It delegates requests to other objects. Very abstract classes and interfaces might be coordinators as they delegate the work to subclasses.\n- **User Interfacer**: Responsible for transmitting user requests for action or display/render information that can be updated. It handles interactions with users.\n- **External Interfacer**: Responsible for loading and storing information from/to external services, including database systems, web services, filesystems, hardware, etc.\n- **Internal Interfacer**: Responsible for interfacing between two subsystems. It may bundle together information of requests from a group of objects to be sent to another object. Abstract adapters, bridges, facades, and proxies are internal interfacers.\n\nIn `roleStereotypeReason`, explain why this class fits your role stereotype of choice but not the other role stereotypes.\n\nFor the `layer`, consider the functionalities of architectural layers below:\n- **Presentation Layer**: Manages the user interface, defines UI elements and behavior, displays information, responds to user input, and updates views.

Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Coordinator' and '(Application) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic, represents domain data and behavior, and performs necessary computations for domain operations. Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Information Holder', 'Service Provider', 'Structurer', 'Coordinator', and '(Domain) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Data Source Layer**: Interacts with databases, filesystems, hardware, messaging systems, or other data sources, performs CRUD operations, handles data conversion, and ensures data integrity.

It usually implements a specific interface with a small number of methods. Concrete strategies are service providers.\n- **Structurer**: Responsible for managing relationships and constraints among related things. It is usually a collection or mapping of some sort.\n- **Controller**: Responsible for making decisions, directing the work of others, and handling important events. It directs the flow of the application or business process.\n- **Coordinator**: Responsible for managing the actions of a group of workers and facilitating communication and work of other objects. It delegates requests to other objects. Very abstract classes and interfaces might be coordinators as they delegate the work to subclasses.\n- **User Interfacer**: Responsible for transmitting user requests for action or display/render information that can be updated. It handles interactions with users.\n- **External Interfacer**: Responsible for loading and storing information from/to external services, including database systems, web services, filesystems, hardware, etc.\n- **Internal Interfacer**: Responsible for interfacing between two subsystems. It may bundle together information of requests from a group of objects to be sent to another object.

Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Coordinator' and '(Application) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic, represents domain data and behavior, and performs necessary computations for domain operations. Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Information Holder', 'Service Provider', 'Structurer', 'Coordinator', and '(Domain) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Data Source Layer**: Interacts with databases, filesystems, hardware, messaging systems, or other data sources, performs CRUD operations, handles data conversion, and ensures data integrity.

POJOs and Java Beans are usually information holders.\n- **Service Provider**: Responsible for handling requests and performing specific services. It usually implements a specific interface with a small number of methods. Concrete strategies are service providers.\n- **Structurer**: Responsible for managing relationships and constraints among related things. It is usually a collection or mapping of some sort.\n- **Controller**: Responsible for making decisions, directing the work of others, and handling important events. It directs the flow of the application or business process.\n- **Coordinator**: Responsible for managing the actions of a group of workers and facilitating communication and work of other objects. It delegates requests to other objects. Very abstract classes and interfaces might be coordinators as they delegate the work to subclasses.\n- **User Interfacer**: Responsible for transmitting user requests for action or display/render information that can be updated. It handles interactions with users.\n- **External Interfacer**: Responsible for loading and storing information from/to external services, including database systems, web services, filesystems, hardware, etc.\n- **Internal Interfacer**: Responsible for interfacing between two subsystems. It may bundle together information of requests from a group of objects to be sent to another object. Abstract adapters, bridges, facades, and proxies are internal interfacers.\n\nIn `roleStereotypeReason`, explain why this class fits your role stereotype of choice but not the other role stereotypes.\n\nFor the `layer`, consider the functionalities of architectural layers below:\n- **Presentation Layer**: Manages the user interface, defines UI elements and behavior, displays information, responds to user input, and updates views.

Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Coordinator' and '(Application) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic, represents domain data and behavior, and performs necessary computations for domain operations. Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Information Holder', 'Service Provider', 'Structurer', 'Coordinator', and '(Domain) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Data Source Layer**: Interacts with databases, filesystems, hardware, messaging systems, or other data sources, performs CRUD operations, handles data conversion, and ensures data integrity.

POJOs and Java Beans are usually information holders.\n- **Service Provider**: Responsible for handling requests and performing specific services. It usually implements a specific interface with a small number of methods. Concrete strategies are service providers.\n- **Structurer**: Responsible for managing relationships and constraints among related things. It is usually a collection or mapping of some sort.\n- **Controller**: Responsible for making decisions, directing the work of others, and handling important events. It directs the flow of the application or business process.\n- **Coordinator**: Responsible for managing the actions of a group of workers and facilitating communication and work of other objects. It delegates requests to other objects. Very abstract classes and interfaces might be coordinators as they delegate the work to subclasses.\n- **User Interfacer**: Responsible for transmitting user requests for action or display/render information that can be updated. It handles interactions with users.\n- **External Interfacer**: Responsible for loading and storing information from/to external services, including database systems, web services, filesystems, hardware, etc.\n- **Internal Interfacer**: Responsible for interfacing between two subsystems. It may bundle together information of requests from a group of objects to be sent to another object.

Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Coordinator' and '(Application) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic, represents domain data and behavior, and performs necessary computations for domain operations. Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'Information Holder', 'Service Provider', 'Structurer', 'Coordinator', and '(Domain) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Data Source Layer**: Interacts with databases, filesystems, hardware, messaging systems, or other data sources, performs CRUD operations, handles data conversion, and ensures data integrity.
