Call the method to retrieve and remove the top card from the stack.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the stack is not empty to prevent errors. It then removes the last card from the internal list aCards, which represents the stack, and returns that card. The removal is done using the remove() method of the list, specifying the last index. This operation effectively reduces the size of the stack by one.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The card stack must not be empty.'], 'postConditions': ['The top card is removed from the stack and returned.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `push(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method adds a card to the card stack if it is not already present and is not null.. **reason**: The method is provided to manage the addition of cards to a stack while ensuring that duplicates are not allowed.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of CardStack and a Card object. Call the push method on the CardStack instance, passing the Card object as an argument.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks that the provided card is not null and that it is not already contained in the stack using assertions.

The cards will be shuffled automatically upon instantiation.. **howItWorks**: The constructor calls the shuffle method, which is expected to randomize the order of the cards in the deck. The shuffle method likely manipulates an internal data structure that holds the cards. This ensures that every time a Deck object is created, it starts with a different arrangement of cards. The implementation of the shuffle method is not shown, but it typically involves algorithms like Fisher-Yates to achieve randomness.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['A new Deck object is created with its cards shuffled.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `draw()`: **description**: The method draws and returns the top card from the deck.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow players to draw cards from the deck during the game.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that the deck is not empty by calling isEmpty() first. Then, call the draw() method to retrieve the top card from the deck.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the deck is not empty to prevent errors. It then uses the pop() method on the aCards stack to remove and return the top card. The pop() operation modifies the state of the deck by reducing its size. The drawn card is then returned to the caller. This ensures that the deck behaves like a stack, where the last card added is the first one to be drawn.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The deck must not be empty.'], 'postConditions': ['The top card of the deck is removed and returned.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isEmpty()`: **description**: The method checks if the deck of cards is empty.. **reason**: The method is provided to allow users to easily determine whether the deck has any cards left for gameplay.. **howToUse**: To use this method, first create an instance of the Deck class. Then, call the isEmpty() method on that instance to check if the deck is empty.. **howItWorks**: The method calls the isEmpty() method on the aCards collection, which is assumed to be a data structure (like a List) that holds the cards in the deck. If aCards has no elements, isEmpty() returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This provides a simple way to check the state of the deck.

Then, call the push method on the Deck instance, passing the Card object as an argument.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the provided Card object is not null to ensure valid input. It then calls the push method on the aCards stack, which is presumably a stack data structure, to add the Card to the top of the stack. This operation modifies the internal state of the Deck by increasing its size.

This will rearrange the cards in the deck randomly.. **howItWorks**: The method first creates a list to hold all the cards in a standard deck by iterating through all suits and ranks. It then uses the Collections.shuffle() method to randomize the order of the cards in the list. Finally, it updates the internal card stack of the Deck with the shuffled list of cards.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The deck contains all cards in a randomized order.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n\nExplain the above class on the following aspects:\n\n{ description: \"Describe the responsibility of the class in one sentence.\", \n  roleStereotype:..., \n  roleStereotypeReason:...,\n  layer:...,\n  layerReason:... }\n\nFor the `roleStereotype`, fill the value with one of the following role stereotypes which responsibility is exhibited by the class:\n- **Information Holder**: Responsible for knowing facts and providing information to other objects.

Finally, the view registers itself as a listener to the GameModel, allowing it to respond to changes in the game state.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pIndex parameter must not be null.', 'The GameModel instance must be initialized before this constructor is called.'], 'postConditions': ['A CardPileView instance is created and configured with the specified TableauPile.', 'The CardPileView is registered as a listener to the GameModel.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragDetectedHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates a drag detected event handler for a card represented by an ImageView, enabling the card to be dragged within the user interface.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate drag-and-drop functionality for cards in the user interface, enhancing user interaction.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of ImageView for the card and a Card object. Then, assign the returned event handler to the ImageView's drag detected event.. **howItWorks**: The method initializes a drag-and-drop operation on the ImageView when a drag event is detected. It creates a Dragboard and sets its content to a serialized representation of the card's substack. The method consumes the mouse event to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The ImageView and Card objects must be initialized and valid.', 'The GameModel instance must be accessible to retrieve the substack.'], 'postConditions': [\"A drag-and-drop operation is initiated with the card's serialized data.\", 'The mouse event is consumed to prevent default behavior.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragDroppedHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates an event handler for handling drag-and-drop events on a card image view, allowing a card to be moved within the game model.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the drag-and-drop functionality for card movement within the Solitaire game interface.. **howToUse**: To use this method, you need to create an instance of CardPileView and call createDragDroppedHandler with the appropriate ImageView and Card. Then, set the returned event handler to the ImageView's setOnDragDropped method to enable drag-and-drop functionality.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. Inside the handle method, it checks if the dragboard contains a string, retrieves the card information, and performs the card move operation using the GameModel. It sets the drop completion status based on the success of the operation and consumes the event to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The ImageView and Card parameters must not be null.', 'The drag event must contain a valid dragboard with a string representation of the card.'], 'postConditions': ['If the drag operation is successful, the card is moved in the game model.', 'The drag event is consumed to prevent further handling.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragEnteredHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates an event handler that visually indicates a legal drag-and-drop action for a card in a card game interface.. **reason**: The method is provided to enhance user experience by giving visual feedback during drag-and-drop operations in the card game interface.. **howToUse**: To use this method, you would call it with an ImageView and a Card object when setting up drag-and-drop functionality. The returned event handler should be registered to the ImageView to respond to drag events.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. When a drag event occurs, it checks if the move is legal using the GameModel's isLegalMove method. If the move is legal, it applies a DropShadow effect to the ImageView to indicate a valid drop target. Finally, it consumes the event to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The ImageView and Card objects must be initialized before passing them to the method.', 'The drag event must contain a valid dragboard with a string representation of the card.'], 'postConditions': ['If the move is legal, the ImageView will have a DropShadow effect applied.', 'The drag event will be consumed to prevent further handling.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragExitedHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates an event handler that removes any visual effects from an ImageView when a drag event exits the view.. **reason**: The method is provided to enhance user experience by visually indicating when a drag operation is no longer over a specific UI element.. **howToUse**: To use this method, call it with an ImageView and a Card instance. The returned event handler can then be set on the ImageView to respond to drag exit events.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface. When a drag event exits the ImageView, the handle method is invoked, which sets the effect of the ImageView to null, effectively removing any visual indication of a drag operation. The event is then consumed to prevent further processing. This allows for a clean visual state when the drag operation is no longer over the ImageView.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pImageView must not be null.', 'pCard must not be null.'], 'postConditions': ['An EventHandler is returned that can be used to handle drag exit events.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragOverHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates a drag-over event handler for a card image view that checks if a dragged card can be legally moved to the specified card pile.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the drag-and-drop functionality for card movement within the Solitaire game interface.. **howToUse**: To use this method, you need to create an instance of CardPileView and call createDragOverHandler with the appropriate ImageView and Card. Then, set the returned event handler to the ImageView's drag-over event.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. It checks if the drag source is not the ImageView itself and if the dragboard contains a string. If the move is legal according to the game model, it accepts the transfer mode as MOVE.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pImageView must be a valid ImageView instance.', 'The pCard must be a valid Card instance.'], 'postConditions': ['An EventHandler for DragEvent is returned that can be used to handle drag-over events.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `gameStateChanged()`: **description**: The method updates the visual representation of the card pile in response to changes in the game state.. **reason**: The method is provided to ensure that the user interface reflects the current state of the game whenever there is a change.. **howToUse**: This method is typically called by the game controller or another component when the game state changes. It should be invoked whenever there are updates to the game that affect the card pile display.. **howItWorks**: The method calls the `buildLayout()` function, which is responsible for constructing the visual layout of the card pile. This may involve arranging cards, updating their positions, and redrawing the UI elements. The method does not take any parameters or return any values, focusing solely on updating the display. It is likely part of a larger observer pattern where the UI listens for changes in the game state.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The visual representation of the card pile is updated to reflect the current game state.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `getImage(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method retrieves the appropriate image for a given card, either showing the card's face if it is visible in the tableau or the card's back if it is not.. **reason**: The method is provided to encapsulate the logic for determining which image to display based on the visibility of the card in the game.. **howToUse**: To use this method, call it with a Card object as an argument. It will return the corresponding image based on the card's visibility status in the tableau.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks if the card is visible in the tableau using the GameModel's instance method. If the card is visible, it retrieves the card's image using CardImages.getCard(pCard). If not, it retrieves the back image using CardImages.getBack(). This encapsulates the logic for image retrieval based on game state.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null.'], 'postConditions': [\"The returned image is either the card's face image or the card's back image.\"]}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n\nExplain the above class on the following aspects:\n\n{ description: \"Describe the responsibility of the class in one sentence.\", \n  roleStereotype:..., \n  roleStereotypeReason:...,\n  layer:...,\n  layerReason:... }\n\nFor the `roleStereotype`, fill the value with one of the following role stereotypes which responsibility is exhibited by the class:\n- **Information Holder**: Responsible for knowing facts and providing information to other objects.

When a card is dragged over this component and dropped, the handler will process the event and attempt to move the card.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. It checks if the dragboard contains a string representation of a card, creates a CardTransfer object, and performs the card move operation using the GameModel. The success of the operation is communicated back to the drag event, and the event is consumed to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The drag event must contain a valid string representation of a card.', 'The GameModel must be properly initialized and accessible.'], 'postConditions': ['If the card move is successful, the drop is marked as completed.', 'The drag event is consumed to prevent further handling.']}. **layer**: Service Layer. \n- `createOnDragEnteredHandler()`: **description**: The method creates an event handler that changes the style of a SuitStack when a drag event enters it, provided the drag operation is legal.. **reason**: The method is provided to visually indicate to the user that a drag operation is valid and can be accepted by the SuitStack.. **howToUse**: This method is typically used in the context of setting up drag-and-drop functionality for a SuitStack in a graphical user interface. It should be assigned to the drag entered event of the SuitStack to handle visual feedback during drag operations.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. When a drag event occurs, it retrieves the dragged card information and checks if the move is legal using the GameModel. If the move is legal and only one card is being dragged, it changes the style of the SuitStack to indicate that it can accept the card. Finally, it consumes the event to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['A drag event must be initiated with a valid dragboard containing card information.'], 'postConditions': [\"If the move is legal, the SuitStack's style is updated to indicate it can accept the dragged card.\"]}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createOnDragExitedHandler()`: **description**: The method creates an event handler that resets the style of a SuitStack when a drag event exits its area.. **reason**: This method is provided to define the visual feedback for drag-and-drop interactions within the user interface.. **howToUse**: To use this method, it should be called to set up the drag exit event handler for a SuitStack instance. The returned handler can be assigned to the appropriate UI component's drag exit event.. **howItWorks**: The method returns an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface. When a drag event exits the SuitStack, the handle method is invoked, which sets the style of the SuitStack to a normal border style. It also consumes the event to prevent further propagation.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': [\"The SuitStack's style is set to normal after a drag event exits.\"]}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createOnDragOverHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView)`: **description**: The method creates an event handler for drag-over events on a specified ImageView, allowing for the acceptance of card moves based on game rules.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate drag-and-drop functionality for card movements in the Solitaire game, ensuring that only legal moves are accepted.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of SuitStack and call createOnDragOverHandler with an ImageView as an argument. Then, set the returned event handler to the ImageView's onDragOver property.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. It checks if the drag source is not the same as the target view and if the dragboard contains a string. If the conditions are met and the move is legal according to the game model, it accepts the transfer mode as MOVE.

Ensure that the game state is valid and that the specified location contains cards.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks if the provided location is the discard pile and pops a card from it if not empty. If the location is a foundation pile, it verifies that the pile is not empty and pops a card from it. For tableau piles, it assumes the location is valid and pops a card from the specified tableau pile.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The provided location must be a valid instance of Location.', 'If the location is DISCARD_PILE, it must not be empty.', 'If the location is a FoundationPile, it must not be empty.', 'If the location is a TableauPile, it must be a valid instance.'], 'postConditions': ['A card is removed from the specified location if it was not empty.', 'The state of the game model is updated to reflect the removal of the card.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `addListener(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.GameModelListener)`: **description**: The method adds a listener to the game model, allowing it to notify the listener of changes in the game state.. **reason**: The method is provided to enable the observer pattern, allowing external components to react to changes in the game model.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of a class that implements the GameModelListener interface. Then, call the addListener method on a GameModel instance, passing the listener instance as an argument.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the provided listener is not null to prevent null pointer exceptions. It then adds the listener to a collection (aListeners) that holds all registered listeners. This collection can later be used to notify all listeners of any changes in the game model. The use of assertions helps ensure that the method is used correctly during development.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pListener parameter must not be null.'], 'postConditions': ['The pListener is added to the aListeners collection.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.GameModel()`: **description**: The method initializes a new instance of the GameModel class and resets its state.. **reason**: The constructor is provided to ensure that every new GameModel instance starts in a defined state by calling the reset method.. **howToUse**: To use this method, simply create a new instance of the GameModel class using the 'new' keyword. This will automatically invoke the constructor and initialize the game model.. **howItWorks**: The method is a private constructor that calls the reset method to set up the initial state of the game model. The reset method likely initializes various attributes and prepares the game for play. By being private, it restricts instantiation to within the class itself, promoting controlled creation of GameModel instances. This design pattern may be part of a singleton or factory pattern.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['A new GameModel instance is created with its state reset.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `canUndo()`: **description**: The method checks if there are any moves available to undo in the game.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow the game to determine if the user can revert the last action taken.. **howToUse**: Call the canUndo() method to check if there are any moves available to undo before attempting to perform an undo operation. It is typically used in response to user actions in the game interface.. **howItWorks**: The method accesses the aMoves collection, which stores the history of moves made in the game.

If not, it simply returns a card move to the specified destination.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The card must be a valid instance of ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card.', 'The destination must be a valid instance of ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.Location.'], 'postConditions': ['A valid move object is returned representing the action of moving the card.', 'If applicable, the top card of the tableau pile is revealed.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getDiscardMove()`: **description**: The method retrieves the current discard move from the game model.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow access to the discard move, which is essential for game logic and state management.. **howToUse**: To use this method, call it on an instance of GameModel. It will return the Move object representing the current discard move.. **howItWorks**: The method simply returns the value of the instance variable aDiscardMove, which is expected to hold the current discard move. There are no calculations or conditions involved in this method. It acts as a getter for the private field. This allows other parts of the application to access the discard move without modifying it.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The returned Move object is the current discard move.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getNullMove()`: **description**: The method returns a predefined null move object that represents a no-operation in the game.. **reason**: This method is provided to offer a standardized way to retrieve a null move, which can be useful in various game logic scenarios.. **howToUse**: Call the getNullMove() method when you need to represent a move that does not change the game state. This can be useful in scenarios where a move is required but no valid action is available.. **howItWorks**: The method overrides a superclass method to provide specific functionality for the GameModel class. It returns a static constant NULL_MOVE from the GameModel class, which is presumably defined as a no-operation move. This ensures that the same instance is used throughout the application, promoting consistency. The method does not take any parameters and directly accesses the class-level constant.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The returned Move object is a valid instance of NULL_MOVE.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getScore()`: **description**: The method retrieves the current score of the game by returning the total size of the foundations.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow access to the game's score, which is a key aspect of the game's state.. **howToUse**: To use this method, an instance of the GameModel class must be created or obtained. Once the instance is available, simply call the getScore() method to retrieve the current score.. **howItWorks**: The method accesses the aFoundations object, which is assumed to represent the game's foundations. It calls the getTotalSize() method on this object, which presumably calculates and returns the total number of cards in the foundations. The returned value is then provided as the score of the game.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The returned score accurately reflects the total number of cards in the foundations.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getSubStack(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: The method retrieves a sub-stack of cards from a specified tableau pile starting from a given card.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the retrieval of a sequence of cards from a tableau pile, which is essential for game mechanics.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that you have a valid card and tableau pile. Call the method with these parameters to obtain the sub-stack of cards starting from the specified card.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that both the card and pile are not null and that the card belongs to the specified pile. It then calls the `getSequence` method on the `aTableau` object, passing the card and pile to retrieve the desired sub-stack of cards.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null', 'pPile must not be null', 'pCard must belong to pPile'], 'postConditions': ['Returns a CardStack representing the sequence of cards starting from pCard in pPile']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getTableauPile(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: This method retrieves a specific tableau pile from the game model based on the provided index.. **reason**: The method is provided to allow access to the tableau piles in the game model, facilitating gameplay operations.. **howToUse**: To use this method, first create an instance of the GameModel class. Then, call getTableauPile with a valid TableauPile index to retrieve the corresponding CardStack.. **howItWorks**: The method uses the aTableau object, which presumably contains all the tableau piles, and calls its getPile method with the provided index. This effectively delegates the responsibility of retrieving the pile to the aTableau object. The method returns the CardStack associated with the specified tableau pile index. It ensures that the retrieval process is encapsulated within the GameModel class.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pIndex must not be null.', 'pIndex must be a valid index within the bounds of the tableau piles.'], 'postConditions': ['A CardStack corresponding to the specified tableau pile is returned.', 'The returned CardStack may be empty if the tableau pile has no cards.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `instance()`: **description**: The method provides a singleton instance of the GameModel class.. **reason**: The method is provided to ensure that there is only one instance of GameModel throughout the application, following the singleton design pattern.. **howToUse**: Call the instance() method to obtain the GameModel instance. This should be done whenever you need to access the game model in your application. It ensures that you are working with the same instance across different parts of the application.. **howItWorks**: The method accesses a static field named INSTANCE within the GameModel class. This field is expected to hold the single instance of the GameModel. By returning this instance, the method enforces the singleton pattern, preventing the creation of multiple instances.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['A single instance of GameModel is returned.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isBottomKing(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method checks if the given card is a bottom king in the tableau.. **reason**: The method is provided to encapsulate the logic for determining if a specific card is a bottom king within the tableau, ensuring that this logic is centralized and reusable.. **howToUse**: To use this method, first ensure that you have a valid card object that is part of the tableau. Then, call the method with the card as an argument to check if it is a bottom king.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the provided card is not null and that it is contained within the tableau. It then delegates the actual check to the `isBottomKing` method of the tableau, which contains the specific logic for determining if the card is a bottom king.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null', 'pCard must be contained in aTableau'], 'postConditions': ['Returns true if pCard is a bottom king, otherwise false']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isCompleted()`: **description**: The method checks if the game is completed by verifying if all cards have been moved to the foundations.. **reason**: This method is provided to determine the end state of the game, indicating whether the player has successfully completed the solitaire game.. **howToUse**: To use this method, call it on an instance of GameModel after performing game actions. It will return a boolean indicating if the game has been completed.. **howItWorks**: The method retrieves the total size of the foundations using aFoundations.getTotalSize(). It then compares this size to the total number of cards in the game, which is calculated as the product of the number of ranks and suits.

Finally, it notifies listeners of the change.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The card to be moved must exist in the game model.', 'The destination must be a valid location.'], 'postConditions': ['The card is moved to the specified destination.', 'The game state is updated accordingly.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `notifyListeners()`: **description**: The method notifies all registered listeners that the game state has changed.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the observer pattern, allowing listeners to react to changes in the game state.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that listeners implementing the GameModelListener interface are registered with the GameModel instance. Call notifyListeners() whenever a change in the game state occurs to update all listeners.. **howItWorks**: The method iterates through a collection of registered listeners stored in the aListeners variable. For each listener, it invokes the gameStateChanged() method, which is expected to be implemented by the listener. This allows each listener to perform necessary updates in response to the game state change. The method does not handle any exceptions or errors that may arise during listener notification.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': []}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `peekDiscardPile()`: **description**: The method retrieves the top card from the discard pile without removing it.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow access to the top card of the discard pile for game logic without modifying the state of the pile.. **howToUse**: Call this method when you need to check the top card of the discard pile. Ensure that the discard pile is not empty before calling this method to avoid assertion errors.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the discard pile is not empty to ensure safe access. It then uses the `peek()` method of the underlying data structure (likely a stack) to retrieve the top card without removing it. This allows other parts of the game to view the card while maintaining the integrity of the discard pile.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The discard pile is not empty.'], 'postConditions': ['The state of the discard pile remains unchanged.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `peekSuitStack(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.FoundationPile)`: **description**: The method retrieves the top card from a specified foundation pile without removing it.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow access to the top card of a foundation pile for game logic without modifying the state of the pile.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that you have a valid FoundationPile object that is not empty. Call the peekSuitStack method with this FoundationPile to retrieve the top card.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the provided FoundationPile is not null and is not empty. It then calls the peek method on the aFoundations object, passing the specified pile to retrieve the top card without removing it. The method returns this card to the caller.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pPile must not be null', 'pPile must not be empty'], 'postConditions': ['The state of pPile remains unchanged']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `reset()`: **description**: The reset() method reinitializes the game state by clearing moves, shuffling the deck, and setting up the foundations and tableau.. **reason**: The method is provided to allow players to restart the game from a clean state without having to create a new instance of the game model.. **howToUse**: Call the reset() method when you want to start a new game or reset the current game state. Ensure that the game model instance is properly initialized before invoking this method.. **howItWorks**: The method first clears any recorded moves to start fresh. It then shuffles the deck to randomize the card order, clears the discard pile, and initializes the foundations and tableau with the shuffled deck. Finally, it notifies any listeners about the state change to update the UI or other components.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The game model must be initialized.', 'The deck must be populated with cards.'], 'postConditions': ['The game state is reset to the initial configuration.', 'Listeners are notified of the state change.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `tryToAutoPlay()`: **description**: The method attempts to automatically perform a legal move in the game and returns whether a valid move was made.. **reason**: This method is provided to facilitate automated gameplay, allowing the game to progress without user intervention when possible.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that an instance of GameModel is created and that a valid playing strategy is set. Call the tryToAutoPlay() method to attempt an automatic move.. **howItWorks**: The method first retrieves a legal move using the aPlayingStrategy's getLegalMove() method. It then performs the move using the perform() method of the Move object. Finally, it checks if the move is null to determine if a valid move was made and returns the result.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['aPlayingStrategy is initialized', 'the game state allows for a legal move'], 'postConditions': ['the game state is updated if a legal move was performed', 'the return value indicates the success of the move attempt']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `undoLast()`: **description**: The method undoes the last move made in the game if there are any moves available to undo.. **reason**: The method is provided to allow players to revert their last action, enhancing the user experience by providing a way to correct mistakes.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that there are moves recorded in the game. Call the undoLast() method to revert the most recent move.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks if the stack of moves (aMoves) is not empty. If there are moves available, it pops the last move from the stack and calls its undo method. This effectively reverses the last action taken in the game.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The aMoves stack must be initialized.', 'There must be at least one move in the aMoves stack.'], 'postConditions': ['The last move is undone, and the state of the game reflects this change.', 'The aMoves stack has one less move after the operation.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n\nExplain the above class on the following aspects:\n\n{ description: \"Describe the responsibility of the class in one sentence.\", \n  roleStereotype:..., \n  roleStereotypeReason:...,\n  layer:...,\n  layerReason:... }\n\nFor the `roleStereotype`, fill the value with one of the following role stereotypes which responsibility is exhibited by the class:\n- **Information Holder**: Responsible for knowing facts and providing information to other objects.

It then checks the aVisible collection to see if the card is present, returning true if it is and false otherwise.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The card must be part of the tableau.'], 'postConditions': ['The method returns true if the card is in the aVisible collection, otherwise false.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `moveWithin(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: The method moves a specified card from one TableauPile to another within the Solitaire game.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the movement of cards between TableauPiles, which is a core interaction in the Solitaire game.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that the card to be moved is visible and exists in the origin pile. Call the method with the card and the two piles as arguments to move the card from the origin to the destination pile.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the parameters are valid and that the card is in the origin pile and visible. It then pops cards from the origin pile until it finds the specified card, pushing each popped card onto a temporary stack. After locating the card, it pops all cards from the temporary stack back onto the destination pile, effectively moving the specified card.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard, pOrigin, and pDestination must not be null.', 'pCard must be contained in pOrigin.', 'pCard must be visible.'], 'postConditions': ['pCard is removed from pOrigin and added to pDestination.', 'All cards above pCard in pOrigin are moved to pDestination.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `pop(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: The method removes the top card from a specified TableauPile and updates the visible cards accordingly.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the removal of cards from the tableau piles, which is a core operation in the game of Solitaire.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that the specified TableauPile is not empty. Call the pop method with the desired TableauPile index to remove the top card from that pile.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the specified TableauPile is not empty to prevent errors. It then retrieves the top card from the specified pile using the pop method of the TableauPile class. Finally, it removes this card from the visible cards collection, ensuring that the game state is updated correctly.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The specified TableauPile must not be empty.'], 'postConditions': ['The top card of the specified TableauPile is removed and no longer visible.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `push(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: This method adds a specified card to a designated tableau pile and marks it as visible.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the addition of cards to tableau piles, which is a fundamental operation in the game of Solitaire.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that you have a valid card and a tableau pile index. Call the push method with these parameters to add the card to the specified pile.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that both the card and the tableau pile index are not null. It then retrieves the specified tableau pile from a collection of piles and pushes the card onto it. Finally, the card is added to a visible collection to track its visibility in the game.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null.', 'pIndex must not be null.'], 'postConditions': ['The card is added to the specified tableau pile.', 'The card is marked as visible.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `revealsTop(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method determines if revealing a specified card will expose the card directly beneath it in the tableau.. **reason**: This method is provided to facilitate the game logic by determining the visibility state of cards in the tableau.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that the card you want to check is part of the tableau. Call the method with the card as an argument to determine if revealing it will expose the card underneath.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks if the provided card is valid and present in the tableau. It then retrieves the card that is directly beneath the specified card. If the specified card is visible and the card beneath it is not, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null.', 'pCard must be contained within the tableau.'], 'postConditions': ['Returns true if revealing pCard exposes the card beneath it; otherwise, returns false.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `showTop(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: The method adds the top card of a specified TableauPile to the visible cards collection.. **reason**: The method is provided to update the visible state of the game by revealing the top card of a specified pile.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that the specified TableauPile is not empty. Call showTop with the desired TableauPile index to add its top card to the visible cards.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the specified TableauPile is not empty to prevent errors. It then retrieves the top card of the specified pile using the peek method. Finally, it adds this card to the aVisible collection, which likely represents the cards currently displayed to the user.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The specified TableauPile must not be empty.'], 'postConditions': ['The top card of the specified TableauPile is added to the aVisible collection.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n\nExplain the above class on the following aspects:\n\n{ description: \"Describe the responsibility of the class in one sentence.\", \n  roleStereotype:..., \n  roleStereotypeReason:...,\n  layer:...,\n  layerReason:... }\n\nFor the `roleStereotype`, fill the value with one of the following role stereotypes which responsibility is exhibited by the class:\n- **Information Holder**: Responsible for knowing facts and providing information to other objects.
