Call the method to retrieve and remove the top card from the stack.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the stack is not empty to prevent errors. It then removes the last card from the internal list aCards, which represents the stack, and returns that card. The use of aCards.size() - 1 ensures that the last card is accessed. This operation modifies the state of the CardStack by reducing its size.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The CardStack must not be empty.'], 'postConditions': ['The size of the CardStack is reduced by one.', 'The top card is removed and returned.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `push(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method adds a card to the card stack if it is not already present and is not null.. **reason**: The method is provided to manage the addition of cards to the stack while ensuring that no duplicate or null cards are added.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of CardStack and call push with a Card object. Ensure that the Card object is not null and is not already in the stack.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks that the provided card is not null and that it is not already contained in the stack using assertions. If both conditions are satisfied, the card is added to the internal list of cards (aCards). This ensures the integrity of the card stack by preventing duplicates and null entries.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null', 'pCard must not already be in aCards'], 'postConditions': ['pCard is added to aCards']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `size()`: **description**: The method returns the number of cards currently in the CardStack.. **reason**: The method is provided to allow users to easily retrieve the size of the card stack, which is essential for managing game logic and user interactions.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of CardStack and add cards to it. Then, call the size() method on the instance to get the current number of cards.. **howItWorks**: The method accesses the aCards collection, which presumably holds the cards in the stack. It calls the size() method on this collection, which is likely a List or similar data structure. The result is returned as an integer representing the number of cards. This implementation is straightforward and efficient, as it directly queries the underlying data structure.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The returned value accurately reflects the number of cards in the CardStack.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n\nExplain the above class on the following aspects:\n\n{ description: \"Describe the responsibility of the class in one sentence.\", \n  roleStereotype:..., \n  roleStereotypeReason:...,\n  layer:...,\n  layerReason:... }\n\nFor the `roleStereotype`, fill the value with one of the following role stereotypes which responsibility is exhibited by the class:\n- **Information Holder**: Responsible for knowing facts and providing information to other objects.

It should be invoked whenever the state of the card pile changes to refresh the displayed cards.. **howItWorks**: The method first clears any existing children from the UI component. It retrieves the card stack for the specified tableau pile index and checks if it is empty. If not empty, it iterates through the cards in the stack, creating image views for each card, setting their positions, and adding them to the UI. It also sets up drag-and-drop event handlers for each card image based on its visibility in the tableau.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The method assumes that the GameModel instance is properly initialized.', 'The aIndex parameter must be a valid index for the tableau piles.'], 'postConditions': ['The UI component will contain image views representing the current state of the card pile.', 'Event handlers for drag-and-drop interactions will be set up for each visible card.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.gui.CardPileView(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: This constructor initializes a CardPileView instance for a given TableauPile, setting its layout and registering it as a listener to the game model.. **reason**: The method is provided to create a visual representation of a TableauPile in the Solitaire game, allowing for user interaction and display of card elements.. **howToUse**: To use this constructor, create an instance of TableauPile and pass it as an argument to the CardPileView constructor. The CardPileView will then be set up to display the cards in the specified TableauPile.. **howItWorks**: The constructor assigns the provided TableauPile to the instance variable aIndex. It sets padding and alignment for the view, builds the layout for displaying cards, and registers the view as a listener to the GameModel to respond to game state changes.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The provided TableauPile instance must not be null.'], 'postConditions': ['A CardPileView instance is created and configured to display the specified TableauPile.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragDetectedHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates a drag detected event handler for a card image view that initiates a drag-and-drop operation for the specified card.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the drag-and-drop functionality for cards in the Solitaire game interface.. **howToUse**: To use this method, you need to pass an ImageView of the card and the corresponding Card object. The returned event handler should be set to the ImageView to handle drag detected events.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for MouseEvent. When a drag is detected, it starts a drag-and-drop operation on the ImageView and sets the content of the dragboard with serialized card data. The event is then consumed to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pImageView must be a valid ImageView instance.', 'The pCard must be a valid Card instance.'], 'postConditions': ['A drag-and-drop operation is initiated for the specified card.', 'The dragboard contains the serialized representation of the card.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragDroppedHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates an event handler for handling drag-and-drop events for a card in the Solitaire game.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the drag-and-drop functionality for cards in the Solitaire game, enhancing user interaction.. **howToUse**: To use this method, instantiate a CardPileView object and call createDragDroppedHandler with the appropriate ImageView and Card. Then, set the returned event handler to the ImageView's onDragDropped property.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. It checks if the dragboard contains a string, retrieves the card information from it, and performs a card move operation. The success of the operation is indicated by setting the drop completion status of the event. Finally, the event is consumed to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The drag event must be initiated with a valid dragboard containing card information.', 'The CardPileView instance must be properly initialized.'], 'postConditions': ['The card move operation is performed if the dragboard contains valid data.', 'The drag event is marked as completed or not based on the success of the operation.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragEnteredHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates an event handler that visually indicates a legal drag-and-drop action for a card in the Solitaire game.. **reason**: The method is provided to enhance user interaction by visually indicating valid drop targets during drag-and-drop operations in the game.. **howToUse**: To use this method, you need to call it with an ImageView and a Card instance when setting up drag-and-drop functionality. The returned event handler should be registered to the drag-entered event of the target UI component.. **howItWorks**: The method defines an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface for DragEvent. When a drag event occurs, it checks if the move is legal using the GameModel's isLegalMove method. If the move is legal, it applies a drop shadow effect to the ImageView to indicate a valid drop target.

This handler can then be set on the ImageView to respond to drag exit events.. **howItWorks**: The method returns an anonymous inner class that implements the EventHandler interface. When the handle method is invoked due to a drag exit event, it removes any visual effects applied to the ImageView. It also consumes the event to prevent further processing.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pImageView must be a valid ImageView instance.', 'The pCard must be a valid Card instance.'], 'postConditions': ['The visual effect of pImageView is set to null when the drag event exits.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `createDragOverHandler(javafx.scene.image.ImageView,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method creates a drag-over event handler for a card pile view that determines if a dragged card can be legally moved to that pile.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the drag-and-drop functionality of cards within the Solitaire game, ensuring that only legal moves are accepted.. **howToUse**: To use this method, you need to create an instance of CardPileView and call createDragOverHandler with the appropriate ImageView and Card parameters. The returned event handler should be set on the ImageView to handle drag-over events.. **howItWorks**: The method returns an event handler that checks if the source of the drag event is not the same as the target ImageView. It then verifies if the dragboard contains a string representation of a card and checks if the move is legal using the GameModel. If the move is legal, it accepts the transfer mode as MOVE.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pImageView must be a valid ImageView instance.', 'The pCard must be a valid Card instance.'], 'postConditions': ['An EventHandler for DragEvent is returned that can be used to handle drag-over events.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `gameStateChanged()`: **description**: The method updates the layout of the card pile view in response to changes in the game state.. **reason**: The method is provided to ensure that the user interface reflects the current state of the game whenever there is a change.. **howToUse**: This method is typically called by the game controller or another component when the game state changes. It should be invoked whenever there are updates to the game that require the UI to be refreshed.. **howItWorks**: The method overrides a base class or interface method to provide specific behavior for the card pile view. It calls the `buildLayout()` method, which is responsible for constructing or updating the visual representation of the card pile. This ensures that any changes in the game state are accurately reflected in the user interface.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The layout of the card pile view is updated to reflect the current game state.']}. **layer**: Presentation Layer. \n- `getImage(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method retrieves the appropriate image representation of a card based on its visibility in the tableau.. **reason**: The method is provided to encapsulate the logic of determining which image to display for a card based on its state in the game.. **howToUse**: To use this method, call it with a Card object as an argument. It will return the corresponding image based on the card's visibility in the tableau.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks if the card is visible in the tableau using the GameModel's instance method.

For tableau piles, it asserts that the location is indeed a tableau and then pops a card from it.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pLocation must be a valid Location object.', 'The specified location must not be empty before attempting to pop a card.'], 'postConditions': ['A card is removed from the specified location if it was not empty.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `addListener(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.GameModelListener)`: **description**: The method adds a listener to the GameModel, allowing it to receive updates about changes in the game state.. **reason**: The method is provided to enable the observer pattern, allowing other components to react to changes in the game model.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of a class that implements GameModelListener. Then, call addListener with that instance to start receiving updates from the GameModel.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the provided listener is not null to prevent null pointer exceptions. It then adds the listener to a collection (aListeners) that holds all registered listeners. This collection can later be used to notify all listeners of any changes in the game state.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The pListener parameter must not be null.'], 'postConditions': ['The pListener is added to the aListeners collection.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.GameModel()`: **description**: The method initializes a new instance of the GameModel class and resets the game state.. **reason**: The constructor is provided to ensure that every new GameModel instance starts with a fresh game state.. **howToUse**: To use this method, simply create a new instance of the GameModel class. This will automatically invoke the constructor and reset the game state.. **howItWorks**: The method is a private constructor that calls the reset() method upon instantiation. The reset() method is expected to set up the initial state of the game, including shuffling cards and placing them in the appropriate positions. Since it is private, it prevents direct instantiation from outside the class, promoting controlled creation of GameModel instances. This design ensures that the game is always in a valid state when created.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['A new GameModel instance is created with a reset game state.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `canUndo()`: **description**: The method checks if there are any moves available to be undone in the game.. **reason**: This method is provided to determine if the user can revert the last action taken in the game, enhancing user experience by allowing undo functionality.. **howToUse**: Call this method when you need to check if an undo operation is possible before executing it.

The method returns true in this case; otherwise, it returns false.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The method accurately reflects the state of the move history.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `find(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: The method finds the location of a specified card within the game's various piles and returns its corresponding location.. **reason**: The method is provided to determine where a specific card is located within the game's structure, which is essential for game logic and state management.. **howToUse**: To use this method, create an instance of GameModel and call find with a Card object as the argument. The method will return the location of the card if it exists in the game model.. **howItWorks**: The method first checks if the card is at the top of the discard pile. If not found, it iterates through the foundation piles to see if the card is present. If still not found, it checks the tableau piles for the card's presence. If the card is not found in any location, it asserts false, indicating an unexpected state.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The GameModel instance must be properly initialized with valid piles.'], 'postConditions': ['The method returns a valid Location or null if the card is not found.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getCardMove(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.Location)`: **description**: The method determines the appropriate move for a specified card to a given destination within the game model of Solitaire.. **reason**: This method is provided to encapsulate the logic for moving a card within the game, ensuring that the rules of Solitaire are adhered to.. **howToUse**: To use this method, instantiate the GameModel class and call getCardMove with a Card object and a Location object. The method will return a Move object that can be executed to perform the card movement.. **howItWorks**: The method first identifies the source location of the card using the find method. If the source is a TableauPile and the top card can be revealed, it creates a CompositeMove that includes both the card move and a reveal move. If not, it simply returns a CardMove for the card to the destination.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['The card must be a valid instance of Card.', 'The destination must be a valid instance of Location.'], 'postConditions': ['A Move object is returned that represents the intended card movement.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getDiscardMove()`: **description**: The method retrieves the current discard move from the game model.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow access to the discard move, which is essential for game logic and state management.. **howToUse**: To use this method, call it on an instance of the GameModel class.

Once the game has progressed and foundations have been populated, calling getScore() will return the current score.. **howItWorks**: The method accesses the aFoundations object, which is expected to manage the game's foundation piles. It calls the getTotalSize() method on aFoundations, which presumably calculates and returns the total number of cards in all foundation piles. The returned value is then provided as the score of the game. This encapsulates the logic for score calculation within the GameModel class.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The returned score accurately reflects the total number of cards in the foundations.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getSubStack(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card,ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: This method retrieves a sub-stack of cards from a specified tableau pile based on a given card.. **reason**: The method is provided to facilitate the retrieval of a sequence of cards from a tableau pile based on a specific card, which is essential for game logic in Solitaire.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that you have a valid card and tableau pile. Call the method with these parameters to obtain the corresponding sub-stack of cards.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that both the card and tableau pile are not null and that the card is indeed part of the specified pile. It then calls the `getSequence` method on the `aTableau` object, passing the card and pile to retrieve the sub-stack of cards.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null', 'pPile must not be null', 'pCard must be found in pPile'], 'postConditions': ['Returns a CardStack representing the sequence of cards starting from pCard in pPile']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `getTableauPile(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.model.TableauPile)`: **description**: This method retrieves a specific tableau pile from the game's tableau structure based on the provided index.. **reason**: The method is provided to allow access to specific tableau piles in the game model, facilitating game operations and interactions.. **howToUse**: To use this method, an instance of GameModel must be created. Call getTableauPile with a valid TableauPile index to retrieve the corresponding CardStack.. **howItWorks**: The method uses the aTableau object, which presumably holds all tableau piles, and calls its getPile method with the provided index. This effectively delegates the responsibility of retrieving the pile to the aTableau object. The method returns the CardStack associated with the specified tableau pile index.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pIndex must be a valid TableauPile index within the bounds of the tableau.'], 'postConditions': ['The returned CardStack corresponds to the specified tableau pile.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `instance()`: **description**: The method returns the singleton instance of the GameModel class.. **reason**: The method is provided to ensure that there is a single instance of the GameModel throughout the application, following the singleton design pattern.. **howToUse**: Call the instance() method to retrieve the GameModel instance. This should be done whenever access to the game model is needed, ensuring that the same instance is used across the application.. **howItWorks**: The method accesses a static field named INSTANCE within the GameModel class. This field is expected to hold the single instance of the GameModel. By returning this instance, the method enforces the singleton pattern, preventing the creation of multiple GameModel instances.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['A valid instance of GameModel is returned.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isBottomKing(ca.mcgill.cs.stg.solitaire.cards.Card)`: **description**: This method checks if the given card is a bottom king in the tableau of the Solitaire game.. **reason**: The method is provided to encapsulate the logic for determining if a specific card is a bottom king within the game's tableau.. **howToUse**: To use this method, ensure that you have an instance of GameModel and a Card object. Call the isBottomKing method with the Card instance as an argument to check its status in the tableau.. **howItWorks**: The method first asserts that the provided card is not null and is contained within the tableau. It then delegates the check to the tableau's isBottomKing method, which contains the actual logic for determining if the card is a bottom king.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': ['pCard must not be null', 'pCard must be contained in aTableau'], 'postConditions': ['Returns true if pCard is a bottom king, otherwise false']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isCompleted()`: **description**: The method checks if the game of Solitaire is completed by verifying if all foundation cards have been found.. **reason**: The method is provided to determine the completion status of the Solitaire game based on the number of cards in the foundations.. **howToUse**: Call the isCompleted() method on an instance of GameModel to check if the game has been completed. Ensure that the game model has been properly initialized and that the foundations have been populated with cards.. **howItWorks**: The method retrieves the total size of the foundation cards using aFoundations.getTotalSize(). It then compares this size to the total number of cards required to complete the game, which is calculated as the product of the number of ranks and suits. If the sizes match, it indicates that all cards have been placed in the foundations, and the game is completed.. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The method returns true if all foundation cards are present, otherwise false.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isDeckEmpty()`: **description**: The method checks if the deck of cards is empty.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow other parts of the application to easily determine the state of the deck without directly accessing its internal representation.. **howToUse**: To use this method, an instance of the GameModel class must be created. Once the instance is available, call the isDeckEmpty() method to check if the deck is empty.. **howItWorks**: The method calls the isEmpty() method on the aDeck object, which is presumably a collection representing the deck of cards. It returns the result of this call, which indicates whether the deck contains any cards. This encapsulates the logic of checking the deck's state within the GameModel class. The method is straightforward and relies on the underlying data structure's implementation of isEmpty().. **assertions**: {'preConditions': [], 'postConditions': ['The method returns a boolean indicating the emptiness of the deck.']}. **layer**: Domain Layer. \n- `isDiscardPileEmpty()`: **description**: The method checks if the discard pile in the game is empty.. **reason**: This method is provided to allow other parts of the game to determine the state of the discard pile, which is essential for game logic.. **howToUse**: To use this method, an instance of the GameModel class must be created or obtained.
