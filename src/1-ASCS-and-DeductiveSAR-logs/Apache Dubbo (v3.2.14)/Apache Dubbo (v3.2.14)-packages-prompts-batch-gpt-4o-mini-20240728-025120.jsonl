Typically (but not only) contains classes with 'User Interfacer' role stereotypes.\n- **Service Layer**: Controls the application flow, orchestrates domain operations, connects UI events with domain logic, and synchronizes domain changes with the UI. Typically (but not only) contains classes with 'Coordinator' and '(Application) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Domain Layer**: Handles business logic, represents domain data and behavior, and performs necessary computations for domain operations. Typically (but not only) contains classes with 'Information Holder', 'Service Provider', 'Structurer', 'Coordinator', and '(Domain) Controller' role stereotypes.\n- **Data Source Layer**: Interacts with databases, filesystems, hardware, messaging systems, or other data sources, performs CRUD operations, handles data conversion, and ensures data integrity. Typically (but not only) contains objects with 'External Interfacer' role stereotypes.\n\nIn `layerReason`, explain why this package fits your layer of choice but not the other layers.\n\nRespond with a well-formatted JSON object.
